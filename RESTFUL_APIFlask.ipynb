It introduces abstractions that make it easier to manage HTTP methods, input parsing, response formatting, and error handling. It also allows for clean, modular, and scalable API design. Whether we are building small APIs or complex systems, Flask-RESTful provides a well-structured and efficient way to handle API endpoints, making it a popular choice among Flask developers."
